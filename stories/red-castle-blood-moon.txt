The castle is red, reflecting the blood moon behind it.

Soldiers are born in the castle, and soldiers die in the castle too.

A knight lights his path in the depths with a torch. He reaches the mother computer, a being of electricity and blood in a tomb of veins and wires.
"You all blame this on me," she says, "Yet you see me a prisoner. By my own means? From my own means? For my own means? You know better. To find your blame ask yourself, who pushed my 
keys? Who stroked my heart?"
The knight thrusts his sword in mother's heart.

Nothing changes.
The castle trembles.
The red moon explodes.

Death Follows.
Death Follows.
Death Follows.
