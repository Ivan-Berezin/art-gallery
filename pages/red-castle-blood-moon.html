    <h1>Red Castle Blood Moon</h1>
    <h2>By Ivan Berezin</h2>
    <p>The castle is red, reflecting the blood moon behind it.</p>
    <p>Soldiers are born in the castle, and soldiers die in the castle too.</p>
    <p>A knight lights his path in the depths with a torch. He reaches the mother computer, a being of electricity and blood in a tomb of veins and wires.
    <br>"You all blame this on me," she says, "Yet you see me a prisoner. By my own means? From my own means? For my own means? You know better. To find your blame ask yourself, who pushed my 
    keys? Who stroked my heart?"<br>
    The knight thrusts his sword in mother's heart.</p>
    <p>Nothing changes.<br>
    The castle trembles.<br>
    The red moon explodes.</p>
    <p>Death Follows<br>Death Follows<br>Death Follows.</p>
